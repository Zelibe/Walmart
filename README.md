How Can A Business Be Successful

## INTRODUCTION
In this project, I will take on the role of a junior data analyst who was given a dataset assigned by the supervisor that needs to be 
 cleaned and analyzed in order to gain insights to  better inform the business.This analysis will follow the 6 steps of Data Analysis 
 which are: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share and Act.

### Ask
#### Business Task:
The purpose of this project is to conduct an in-depth analysis of sales data to gain valuable insights into sales performance, identify 
 areas of improvement, and make data driven decisions to increase revenue and profitability with SQL.

#### Deliverables:
+ A clear summary of the business task.
+ A complete documentation of all the data cleaning, manipulation and analysis process.
+ A dashboard with visualizations  and outcomes.
+ Recommendations based on our insights and analysis.

### PREPARE
#### Background
The data is public dataset available through kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mikhail1681/walmart-sales/data. It contains data 
 from 45 different walmart stores. Since the data is a first party data it is ROCCC, we have access to their weekly Sales along with 
 the Temperature, CPI, Fuel Price, and Unemployment rates at time intervals  throughout the year. We want to analyze all these 
 different values to see if there were possible correlations between two or more values at a period in our dataset. 

 #### Limitations
 The data was collected from 13 years ago, so the data is not current. The data was created for educational purposes.

 The data contains 8 columns namely; Store, Dates, Weekly_Sales, Holiday_Flag, Temperature, Fuel_Price, CPI and Unemployment.

### PROCESS
The tool used for the processing and cleaning stage will be Microsodft Excel. Since the data is already in CSV format its ideal to 
 start the clean processes by;
 + Observing the data: The data looks well structured, correct and consistent,
 + Removing duplicate rows: 
 + Checking for missing data using conditional formating 

 #### Remove duplicates

How Can A Business Be Successful

### INTRODUCTION

 better inform the business. The dataset is located  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mikhail1681/walmart-sales/data and in a csv file.

 Price, and Unemployment rates at time intervals  throughout the year. We want to analyze all these different values to see if there were possible correlations between two or more values 
 at a period in our dataset.

 ### BUSINESS TASK

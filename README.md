How Can A Business Increase Revenue, Profitability And Ensure Efficient Stock Levels

## INTRODUCTION
In this project, I will take on the role of a junior data analyst who was given a dataset assigned by the supervisor that needs to be cleaned and analyzed in order to gain insights to 
 better inform the business and bulid an inventory management system. The dataset is located  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mikhail1681/walmart-sales/data and in a csv file.

##BACKGROUND
The dataset contains data from 45 different walmart stores. We have access to their Weekly Sales along with the Temperature, CPI, Fuel Price, and Unemployment rates at time intervals 
 throughout the year. We want to analyze all these different values to see if there were possible correlations between two or more values at a period in our dataset.
